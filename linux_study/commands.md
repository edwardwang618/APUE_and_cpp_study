Here’s a summary of the standard directories you’ll find in the root (`/`) of a typical **Linux** filesystem and what each one does:

## Common Linux Root Directories

| Directory      | Purpose / Description |
|----------------|----------------------|
| `/bin`         | Essential user binaries (programs). Contains basic commands needed in single-user mode and for all users (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `bash`). |
| `/boot`        | Boot loader files. Contains the Linux kernel, initial RAM disk image, and boot loader configuration files (e.g., GRUB). |
| `/dev`         | Device files. Represents hardware devices as files (e.g., `/dev/sda` for disks, `/dev/tty` for terminals). |
| `/etc`         | Host-specific system configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd` for user accounts, `/etc/hostname`). |
| `/home`        | Users’ personal directories (e.g., `/home/alice`). Each user stores their files and settings here. |
| `/lib`         | Essential shared libraries and kernel modules needed to boot the system and run basic commands. |
| `/lib64`       | 64-bit libraries (on 64-bit systems). Similar to `/lib`, but specifically for 64-bit binaries. |
| `/media`       | Mount point for removable media (e.g., USB drives, DVDs) that are automatically mounted. |
| `/mnt`         | Temporary mount point for filesystems (used by system administrators for manual mounting). |
| `/opt`         | Optional application software packages. Used for installing add-on software. |
| `/proc`        | Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files (e.g., `/proc/cpuinfo`). |
| `/root`        | Home directory for the root (administrator) user. Not to be confused with `/`. |
| `/run`         | Volatile runtime data (e.g., information about running system since last boot). |
| `/sbin`        | Essential system binaries. Contains important system administration programs (e.g., `fsck`, `reboot`). |
| `/srv`         | Data for services provided by the system (e.g., web or FTP servers). |
| `/sys`         | Virtual filesystem for system and hardware information (similar to `/proc`). |
| `/tmp`         | Temporary files used by programs. Cleared at reboot. |
| `/usr`         | Secondary hierarchy for user programs and data. Contains most user utilities and applications. |
| `/var`         | Variable data, such as logs (`/var/log`), mail (`/var/mail`), and print queues. |

## Notes

- On some systems, you may see extra directories or subtle differences.
- **Do not delete or move these directories** unless you know what you're doing—they are critical for system operation.
- Many directories (e.g., `/usr`, `/var`) have their own substructure for organizing files.

If you want deeper details about any specific directory, let me know!
